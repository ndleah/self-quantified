With the emergence of digital mapping (mid 1980s), the (then) Lands Department of Victoria defined a projection which would allow Victoria to be viewed as a single, continuous map coverage, rather than as multiple zones. This projection, known in VicRoads as Pseudo AMG, is based on AGD 66, but uses a UTM modified to have scale distortion of 1.0 at its centre, a centre based on 145 degrees longitude (Melbourne) and a single zone covering the whole state." | e.g. 2390265.155                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
